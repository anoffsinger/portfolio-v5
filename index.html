		<p>Hi, I'm Adam</p>
		<p>I’m a designer working at the intersection of visual design, prototyping, and motion design. Right now, I’m at <span id="test-span">Patreon</span> designing the best future for the creators of today.</p>
		<p>In the past, I was an early designer at <span>Uber</span> on both Rides and Eats. We redesigned both apps and travelled the world user testing our product. It was awesome and incredibly formative to me. </p>
		<p>After that, I joined <span>Dropbox</span> and focused on design systems. I up-leveled my craft and doubled down on my technical skills while making friends for life. I briefly worked on autonomous ridesharing at <span>Cruise</span> after that, but the pandemic led to my workstream being paused, so I left.</p>
		<p>After that I joined <span>Apple</span>. There, I worked on Pay and Wallet. It was an incredible experience that helped me fully understand myself as a designer. While there, I worked on Tap to Pay and Apple Savings, in addition to some other fun things you might see someday.</p>
		<p>In my freetime, I work on <span>Found</span>. There, I worked on Pay and Wallet. It was an incredible experience that helped me fully understand myself as a designer. While there, I worked on Tap to Pay and Apple Savings, in addition to some other fun things you might see someday.</p>
